Database installation steps:
1. sudo apt install mariadb-server
2. "sudo systemctl enable mariadb" if you want it to start automatically at boot, otherwise disable 
3. sudo systemctl start mariadb
4. systemctl status mariadb (check that it's working)
5. sudo mysql_secure_installation (go through this installation process)
	-Enter the current password for root: (just press enter)
	-Switch to unix_socket authentication: n
	-Change the root password?: n
	-Remove anonymous users?: y
	-Disallow root login remotely?: y
	-Remove test database and access to it?: y
	-Reload privilege tables now?: y
6. sudo mysql (to enter the database)

Inside the database:
Create a user "grant all on *.* to 'admin' identified by 'admin' with grant option;" (create a generic admin user)
List users with "select user from mysql.user;"
Create a new database named test "create database test;"
Switch to that database "use test;"
Create a table in that database "create table MyTable (MyColumn int primary key);"
Leave with "quit" or "exit"

python setup:
Required packages (You may already have some of these):
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip build-essential pkg-config python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev

pip install bottle bottle-sqlalchemy mysqlclient
(mysqlclient may fail a few times as it finds the correct version, my Ubuntu VM installed version 2.1.1)

now you should be able to run the test server and add and remove integers using the test database
http://127.0.0.1:8080/			Get the table in JSON format
http://127.0.0.1:8080/add/1		Add the number 1 to the table
http://127.0.0.1:8080/delete/1	Delete 1 from the table
Note: Duplicates are not allowed in this case because the number is the primary key of the table
