Database installation steps:
1. sudo apt install mariadb-server
2. "sudo systemctl enable mariadb" if you want it to start automatically at boot, otherwise disable 
3. sudo systemctl start mariadb
4. systemctl status mariadb (check that it's working)
5. sudo mysql_secure_installation (go through this installation process)
6. sudo mysql (to enter the database)

Inside the database:
Create a user "grant all on *.* to 'admin' identified by 'admin' with grant option;" (create a generic admin user)
List users with "select user from mysql.user;"
Create a new database named test "create database test;"
Switch to that database "use test;"
Create a table in that database "create table MyTable (MyColumn int primary key);"
Leave with "quit" or "exit"

python setup:
pip install bottle
pip install bottle-sqlalchemy
pip install mysqlclient

I ran into an issue with mysqlclient,
	fixed by first running "sudo apt-get install python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev build-essential"

now you should be able to run server.py and add and remove integers using the test database
